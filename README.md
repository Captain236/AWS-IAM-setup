# AWS-IAM-setup
# Introduction
## What is IAM
- **IAM stnds for identity and access management that help us to securely control the aws resources. It allows us to manage users , groups , roles and permissions to define who can access what within your aws environment.**

# Features of IAM

**🔐 1. User Management
You can create, manage, and delete users in your system.
👉 Example: Making accounts for team members in AWS.**

**🛂 Access Control
You decide who can access what in your system.
👉 Example: Give only read access to interns and full access to admins.**

**🧾 Permissions & Policies
You can write rules (called policies) to allow or deny actions.
👉 Example: A rule that says “User A can only view files but not delete them.”**

**👥 Groups
Users can be put into groups to give permissions easily.
👉 Example: A “Developers” group can be allowed to access servers.**

**🆔 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
You give roles instead of direct permissions to users.
👉 Example: Assigning a “DatabaseAdmin” role to someone, so they automatically get DB permissions.**

**🔑 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Adds an extra layer of security using mobile OTP or other devices.
👉 Example: Even if your password is hacked, no one can log in without your phone.**
